A Python library for reading, manipulating, and writing to GnuCash files.

This project was made to create and interact with GNewCash documents in an easy way. It handles reading from and
creating the necessary XML needed to generate the GnuCash documents, as well as making the creation of one
(or multiple) XML tags as simple as changing an object property.
